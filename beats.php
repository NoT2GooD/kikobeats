<!-- This code assumes that you have a database table named "beats" that stores information about each beat such as its name, description, price, and so on. It displays all the beats available for sale, and each beat has an "Add to Cart" button that adds the beat to the user's shopping cart. When the user is ready to checkout, they can click on the "Checkout" button, which will process the payment and place the order.

Please note that this code is just a starting point, and you will need to modify it to suit your specific needs. You may also want to add additional features such as user authentication, order history, and more. --> --> -->
